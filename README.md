# NIM-Game with Q-Learning AI

This repository contains an implementation of the Nim game with an AI agent trained using Q-learning.

## Overview

Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing objects from heaps or piles. The player to remove the last object wins.

This project includes:
- A Python class `Nim` to represent the game.
- A `NimAI` class that uses Q-learning to play the game.
- Training and gameplay scripts to allow interaction with the AI.

## Files

- `nim.py`: Contains the implementation of the `Nim` game and `NimAI` (Q-learning agent).
- `play.py`: Script to train the AI and play against it.
